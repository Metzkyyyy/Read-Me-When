You mean so much more to me than you’ll ever know, my baby. Even when we’re apart or when things get hard, my love doesn’t fade. It doesn’t change or weaken—if anything, it grows stronger. I know distance and time can make things tough, but please never doubt how much you mean to me baby. You’re always in my heart and in my mind, even when we’re not talking, even when everything’s quiet. My love for you doesn’t ever stop; it stays with you. <br><br> When you feel unsure, or when you just need to feel loved, come back to this, omkie baby? Let it remind you that no matter what happens baby, you have someone who loves you deeply, endlessly, and sincerely. You’re my person—the one I’ll always choose, again and again, no matter how far apart we are. You are my always, even from miles away.`;
